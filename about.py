    ### About This Application

    This application serves as a tool to stay updated and informed about the state of ransomware. Its purpose is to shed light on the rapidly evolving landscape of ransomware, which poses an increasing threat to individuals, businesses, and governments around the globe. 

    By providing a comprehensive overview of ransomware incidents, the application allows users to better understand the nature of these threats, which in turn could help in strategizing defenses against them. 

    The data presented here is collected and maintained by the [RansomWatch project](https://github.com/joshhighet/ransomwatch), a dedicated initiative that tracks and compiles information on various ransomware families and incidents. We would like to express our gratitude to them for their incredible work and for making this data publicly accessible. 

    The RansomWatch project is licensed under [Unlicense.org](http://unlicense.org/), which allows for the free use of its software, with or without modification, for any purpose. 

    Remember, knowledge is power, and staying informed is the first step in defending against ransomware threats.
